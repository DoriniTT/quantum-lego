# Python Package Reviews

This directory contains detailed reviews of Python dependencies used in the quantum-lego project.

## Purpose

The Python Fan workflow automatically analyzes each direct dependency from `pyproject.toml` on a rotating schedule, prioritizing recently updated packages. Each review includes:

- Current usage patterns in the project
- Recent package updates and features
- Best practices and recommendations
- Improvement opportunities

## Structure

Each package gets its own markdown file:
- `<package-name>.md` - Detailed review of the package

## Workflow

Reviews are generated by the `python-fan` GitHub Actions workflow, which runs daily on weekdays. The workflow:

1. Selects the next package to review (prioritizing recently updated ones)
2. Researches the package's documentation and recent changes
3. Analyzes how the project uses the package
4. Identifies improvement opportunities
5. Saves a summary here and creates a discussion

## Usage

These reviews can help:
- Stay current with dependency updates
- Identify opportunities to better utilize packages
- Discover new features in existing dependencies
- Maintain code quality and best practices
- Plan dependency upgrades

## Contributing

Package reviews are automatically generated but can be manually updated with additional insights or corrections.
